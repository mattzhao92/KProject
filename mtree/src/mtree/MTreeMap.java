/**
 * A MTreeMap is a Map-like data-structure designed to efficiently support k-nearest-neighbor (kNN)
 * searches, range searches, as well as regular Map style put/get operations. To support kNN
 * searches a MTreeMap requires a Distance Metric object that defines the distance between any two
 * keys. The DistanceMetric should define a true Metric Space in which the following four
 * assumptions are true:
 *
 * (1) d(x,y) >= 0
 * (2) d(x,y) = d(y,x)
 * (3) d(x,z) <= d(x,y) + d(y,z)
 * (4) d(x,y) = 0 if and only if x = y (optional)
 *
 * A MTreeMap is loosely based on the MTree introduced by Paolo Ciaccia, Marco Patella, and Pavel
 * Zezula in 1997 in the paper "M-tree An Efficient Access Method for Similarity Search in Metric
 * Spaces" from the Proceedings of the 23rd VLDB Conference.
 *
 * An MTreeMap is a binary search tree in which each node in the tree owns a sphere. That sphere's
 * radius is set to ensure that every Key beneath that node is located inside that node's sphere.
 * Therefore, the root node of an MTreeMap has a large radius because every Key contained in the
 * MTreeMap must fit inside its sphere. Sub-trees are associated with smaller spheres. Each sphere
 * has a centerpoint and radius whose values are used to route put/get requests, kNN searches, and
 * range searches.
 *
 * When Keys are first added to an MTreeMap they are placed inside a SphereOfPoints. Eventually,
 * that Sphere will have too many entries and needs to be split. When this occurs the SphereOfPoints
 * becomes a SphereOfSpheres that own 2 newly created SphereOfPoints. The 2 new SphereOfPoints
 * contain all the Key+Value pairs that the original "overfilled" SphereOfPoints contained. The
 * centerpoints of the 2 new SphereOfPoints are selected in order to reduce the overlapping volume
 * the 2 new spheres have with each other. Reducing this shared volume reduces the number of spheres
 * a search must visit.
 *
 * When Key+Value pairs are removed from a MTreeMap they are removed, however, the fact that the key
 * was present in the MTreeMap may leave a permanent imprint on the MTreeMap. This occurs when the
 * Key was selected as the centerpoint for a new SphereOfPoints. In this case the Key is still used
 * to route get/put queries even though the Key is no longer associated with a Key+Value pair. Any
 * insertion of a Key can permanently reduce the query routing efficency of an MTreeMap. This
 * occurs when the key insertion forces a Sphere to increase its radius (which will not shrink upon
 * key removal).
 *
 * Importantly, MTreeMaps have no automatic balancing mechanism. Therefore inserting Key+Value pairs
 * where the Keys vary in some predictable way is likely to produce a tree that is unbalanced. In
 * principal, tree balance could be maintained by rotating the Sphere nodes similar to how AVL and
 * Red-Black trees rotate nodes to maintain balance. The makeBalancedCopy() and rebalance() methods
 * are provided to combat tree imbalance, but these method are expensive and should be used
 * sparingly if possible.
